# Project Description

## mDNS Responder for Rust

This is a Rust implementation of an mDNS (Multicast DNS) responder library. mDNS allows hosts on a local network to resolve hostnames and discover services without a traditional DNS server.

## Recent Work Summary

### Bug Fixes and Improvements
1. **Implemented proper shutdown mechanism**: Fixed TODO in `src/lib.rs:177` to properly wait for tasks to complete during shutdown. The `Shutdown` struct now tracks the spawned thread and waits for it to finish when dropped.

2. **Fixed deprecated code warnings**: 
   - Updated trait object syntax to use `dyn` keyword
   - Replaced deprecated `try!` macro with `?` operator
   - Fixed elided lifetime warning

3. **Fixed example compilation**: Corrected the crate name reference in the example to match the actual crate name `mdns_responder_rs`.

### Code Quality Improvements
- All compilation warnings have been resolved
- Code now follows modern Rust best practices
- Tests pass successfully

## Architecture
- Uses tokio for async I/O
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
- Service registration and discovery
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown
