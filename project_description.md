# Project Description

## mDNS Responder for Rust

This is a Rust implementation of an mDNS (Multicast DNS) responder library. mDNS allows hosts on a local network to resolve hostnames and discover services without a traditional DNS server.

## Recent Work Summary

### Code Cleanup and Documentation (Latest)
1. **Added comprehensive documentation**: All public APIs now have detailed rustdoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and behavior.

2. **Modernized to Rust 2018 edition**: 
   - Removed `extern crate` declarations
   - Updated import statements to use `crate::`
   - Fixed all edition-related warnings

3. **Improved error handling**:
   - Replaced panicking `.expect()` calls with proper error logging where appropriate
   - Added informative error messages
   - Graceful error recovery in critical paths

4. **Code simplification**:
   - Extracted complex logic into helper functions (e.g., `build_txt_record`)
   - Removed unnecessary cloning and allocations
   - Simplified iterator patterns and control flow
   - Applied clippy suggestions for idiomatic Rust
   - Used modern format string interpolation

5. **Fixed all compilation warnings**:
   - Updated deprecated syntax
   - Fixed elided lifetimes
   - Applied modern Rust patterns
   - Resolved all clippy lints

### Previous Bug Fixes and Improvements
1. **Implemented proper shutdown mechanism**: Fixed TODO in `src/lib.rs:177` to properly wait for tasks to complete during shutdown. The `Shutdown` struct now tracks the spawned thread and waits for it to finish when dropped.

2. **Fixed deprecated code warnings**: 
   - Updated trait object syntax to use `dyn` keyword
   - Replaced deprecated `try!` macro with `?` operator
   - Fixed elided lifetime warning

3. **Fixed example compilation**: Corrected the crate name reference in the example to match the actual crate name `mdns_responder_rs`.

## Architecture
- Uses tokio for async I/O
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
- Service registration and discovery with TXT records
- Thread-safe service registry with multiple indices
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown

## Code Quality
- All clippy warnings resolved
- Consistent code formatting
- Modern Rust 2018 edition
- Comprehensive documentation
- Tests passing successfully

## Current Development Status (2025-08-10)

### Testing Infrastructure - COMPLETED ✅
- **Comprehensive Test Suite Created**: 22 total tests all passing
  - 15 unit tests covering core functionality
  - 6 integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
  - 1 doc test for usage examples
- Test coverage includes:
  - TXT record building with various edge cases
  - Service registry operations (register/unregister/lookup)
  - Service discovery by name and type
  - Error handling and panic conditions
  - Integration tests for service lifecycle
  - Multi-service registration scenarios

### Tests Implemented
1. **Core Library Functions (lib.rs)** ✅:
   - `build_txt_record()` - 7 tests covering empty, single, multiple entries, edge cases
   
2. **Service Registry (services.rs)** ✅:
   - `ServicesInner::register()` - Tested with unique ID generation
   - `ServicesInner::unregister()` - Tested with cleanup verification
   - `ServicesInner::find_by_name()` - Tested with found/not found cases
   - `ServicesInner::find_by_type()` - Tested with multiple service types
   - Service registry initialization and hostname handling

### Areas Still Requiring Tests

3. **Network Layer**:
   - Platform-specific socket handling (net.rs / netwin.rs)
   - Multicast group management
   - Address family abstraction (address_family.rs)

4. **FSM (Finite State Machine)**:
   - Query handling logic
   - Response generation
   - Command processing

### Session Summary (2025-08-10)

#### Major Accomplishments
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite Created**:
   - Implemented 15 unit tests for core functionality
   - Added 6 integration tests for service lifecycle scenarios
   - All 22 tests passing successfully
   - Test coverage includes: TXT record building, service registry, error handling

2. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Fixed clippy warning (FSM → Fsm naming convention)
   - All clippy checks passing with zero warnings
   - Verified example code compilation

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated project_description.md with current development status
   - Maintained overview.md with architectural details
   - Updated todo.md with completed tasks and future priorities

4. **Test Categories Implemented**:
   - TXT record building (7 tests)
   - Service registry operations (8 tests)
   - Integration tests (6 tests)
   - Doc tests (1 test)

### Next Steps
- Add integration tests for service discovery
- Test actual mDNS packet generation and parsing
- Set up continuous integration testing
- Add property-based testing for DNS packet handling
- Create tests for CommandSender and Shutdown mechanisms
