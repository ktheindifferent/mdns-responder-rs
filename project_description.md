# Project Description

## mDNS Responder for Rust

This is a Rust implementation of an mDNS (Multicast DNS) responder library. mDNS allows hosts on a local network to resolve hostnames and discover services without a traditional DNS server.

## Recent Work Summary

### Code Cleanup and Documentation (Latest)
1. **Added comprehensive documentation**: All public APIs now have detailed rustdoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and behavior.

2. **Modernized to Rust 2018 edition**: 
   - Removed `extern crate` declarations
   - Updated import statements to use `crate::`
   - Fixed all edition-related warnings

3. **Improved error handling**:
   - Replaced panicking `.expect()` calls with proper error logging where appropriate
   - Added informative error messages
   - Graceful error recovery in critical paths

4. **Code simplification**:
   - Extracted complex logic into helper functions (e.g., `build_txt_record`)
   - Removed unnecessary cloning and allocations
   - Simplified iterator patterns and control flow
   - Applied clippy suggestions for idiomatic Rust
   - Used modern format string interpolation

5. **Fixed all compilation warnings**:
   - Updated deprecated syntax
   - Fixed elided lifetimes
   - Applied modern Rust patterns
   - Resolved all clippy lints

### Previous Bug Fixes and Improvements
1. **Implemented proper shutdown mechanism**: Fixed TODO in `src/lib.rs:177` to properly wait for tasks to complete during shutdown. The `Shutdown` struct now tracks the spawned thread and waits for it to finish when dropped.

2. **Fixed deprecated code warnings**: 
   - Updated trait object syntax to use `dyn` keyword
   - Replaced deprecated `try!` macro with `?` operator
   - Fixed elided lifetime warning

3. **Fixed example compilation**: Corrected the crate name reference in the example to match the actual crate name `mdns_responder_rs`.

## Architecture
- Uses tokio for async I/O
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
- Service registration and discovery with TXT records
- Thread-safe service registry with multiple indices
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown

## Code Quality
- All clippy warnings resolved
- Consistent code formatting
- Modern Rust 2018 edition
- Comprehensive documentation
- Tests passing successfully
